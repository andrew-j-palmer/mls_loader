wish list, ideas to add

- error checking, validation?
(did the run finish, do we have a sane number of listings?)
    proposed fixes:
        -PHRETS has some of this built in already
        -log records in *WA* db
        -create db for MLS runs with mlsname, time, succeed(t/f)
- do we want to do incrementals for everything?
    fixes:
        -again, PHRETS has some of this built in
        -can get last run "indata" date from db and use
        EXAMPLE IN DMQL2:
            three attr, modtime, status, idx=y
        (RECORDMODDATE=2018-04-23T15:00:05+),(ST=ACTV,BOMK),(IDX=Y)
- if we have incomplete run, what do we want to do?
    probably NOT keep data:
        -two basic outcomes: 
            A) finish without error
            B) finish WITH error and let it be known
