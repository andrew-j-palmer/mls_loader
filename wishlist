wish list, ideas to add
*** TAKE INDATA OUT, JUST REMOVE ANY LISTING NOT PRESENT***


- error checking, validation?
(did the run finish, do we have a sane number of listings?)
    proposed fixes:
        -PHRETS has some of this built in already
        -log records in *WA* db
        -create db for MLS runs with mlsname, time, succeed(t/f)*DONE*
- do we want to do incrementals for everything?*DONE*
    fixes:
        -again, PHRETS has some of this built in*DONE*
        -can get last run "indata" date from db and use*DONE*
        EXAMPLE IN DMQL2:
            three attr, modtime, status, idx=y
        (RECORDMODDATE=2018-04-23T15:00:05+),(ST=ACTV,BOMK),(IDX=Y)
        *IMPLEMENTED*: incremental can be set (T/F) in config, if T then add timestamp compare to
        beginning of each query when running. it works
- if we have incomplete run, what do we want to do?*DONE*(sorta)
    probably NOT keep data:
        -two basic outcomes:
            A) finish without error
            B) finish WITH error and let it be known
            *IMPLEMENTED*: provisity.prev_runs has record of every run, column 'success' is set
            to false until run finishes without error
