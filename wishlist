wish list, ideas to add
*** TAKE INDATA OUT, JUST REMOVE ANY LISTING NOT PRESENT***


- error checking, validation?
(did the run finish, do we have a sane number of listings?)
    proposed fixes:
        -PHRETS has some of this built in already
        -log records in *WA* db
        -have prev_runs db for MLS runs with mlsname, time, succeed(t/f)*DONE*
- do we want to do incrementals for everything?
    How incremental needs to work:
        - check prev_runs for evidence of successful run
        - if success = true, use that time for incremental
        - otherwise, full run until success
- if we have incomplete run, do NOT keep data:
        - again, prev_runs shows successful
        - if incremental time is based on last successful run,
            we should always get every record even if fail
